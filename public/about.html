<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Minahil, but you can call me MOMO. I’m currently navigating my way through my third semester in computer science, diving deep into the exciting world of full stack development.</p>

<p>When I’m not buried in code, you can find me working part-time in e-commerce, soaking up all the knowledge I can about the industry. I’m on a mission to strengthen brand partnerships and discover the ins and outs of the wholesale business—because who doesn’t love a good deal?</p>

<p>In my free time, I unleash my creativity through photography and stone painting. Capturing moments and transforming ordinary stones into little pieces of art keeps my imagination alive and thriving!</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer in lifelong learning, constantly on the lookout for new skills to master, whether through online courses or freelancing .</p>

<p>And let’s be honest, life’s too short to not have a bit of fun! So, while I’m all about growth, I also make sure to enjoy the ride and embrace the little moments along the way.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
